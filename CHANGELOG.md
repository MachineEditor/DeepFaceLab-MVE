## [1.6.0] - 2021-05-04
### Added
- New loss function "MS-SSIM+L1", based on ["Loss Functions for Image Restoration with Neural Networks"](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/loss-functions-image-restoration-neural-networks)

## [1.5.1] - 2021-04-23
### Fixed
- Fixes bug with MS-SSIM when using a version of tensorflow < 1.14

## [1.5.0] - 2021-03-29
### Changed
- Web UI previews now show preview pane as PNG (loss-less), instead of JPG (lossy), so we can see the same output 
  as on desktop, without any changes from JPG compression. This has the side-effect of the preview images loading slower
  over web, as they are now larger, a future update may be considered which would give the option to view as JPG 
  instead.

## [1.4.2] - 2021-03-26
### Fixed 
- Fixes bug in background power with MS-SSIM, that misattributed loss from dst to src

## [1.4.1] - 2021-03-25
### Fixed
- When both Background Power and MS-SSIM were enabled, the src and dst losses were being overwritten with the 
  "background power" losses. Fixed so "background power" losses are properly added with the total losses.
    - *Note: since all the other losses were being skipped when ms-ssim and background loss were being enabled, this had 
      the side-effect of lowering the memory requirements (and raising the max batch size). With this fix, you may 
      experience an OOM error on models ran with both these features enabled. I may revisit this in another feature, 
      allowing you to manually disable certain loss calculations, for similar performance benefits.*

## [1.4.0] - 2021-03-24
### Added
- [MS-SSIM loss training option](doc/features/ms-ssim)
- GAN version option (v2 - late 2020 or v3 - current GAN)
- [GAN label smoothing and label noise options](doc/features/gan-options)
### Fixed
- Background Power now uses the entire image, not just the area outside of the mask for comparison.
This should help with rough areas directly next to the mask

## [1.3.0] - 2021-03-20
### Added
- [Background Power training option](doc/features/background-power/README.md)

- [Random color training option](doc/features/random-color/README.md)

## [1.1.5] - 2021-03-16
